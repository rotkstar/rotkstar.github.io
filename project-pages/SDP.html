          <div class="body-text">In this year-long capstone project, my three teammates and I designed, populated, and tested the PCB for a guitar effects box. This circuit board could interface between an electric guitar and a loudspeaker, and was used for two primary functions. The first function was looping the guitar audio; that is, a user could record a guitar solo and have it loop back continuously as they play additional chords in real time alongside the looping audio. The second function was adding various audio effects to these loops, like reverb, which makes the audio sound like it is echoing about a large room. We also designed a full enclosure to house both the circuit board and its peripherals.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The most difficult aspect of this project was designing a PCB with a high signal to noise ratio and low total harmonic distortion. Achieving these specifications would result in a clear, high quality guitar sound at the output of our system. It took three iterations of PCB design alongside countless hours of circuit simulation, prototyping and testing to achieve our end goal. If you would like to hear the system being demonstrated, click
